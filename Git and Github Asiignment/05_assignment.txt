Q5. Describe the process of contributing to any open-source project on GitHub in a step-by-step manner.

Solution-->

Contributing to an open-source project on GitHub involves several steps. Here's a detailed step-by-step process:

1. Fork the Repository:
   - Go to the open-source project's GitHub repository.
   - Click on the "Fork" button at the top right corner of the repository page. This action creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

2. Clone the Forked Repository:
   - Open the forked repository on your GitHub account.
   - Click the "Code" button and copy the URL of the repository.
   - Open a terminal on your local machine and use the `git clone <repository_URL>` command to clone the repository to your local machine.

3. Create a Branch:
   - Move into the directory of the cloned repository using the `cd` command.
   - Create a new branch for your contribution using `git checkout -b your-branch-name`. This branch will contain the changes you make without affecting the main branch.

4. Make Changes:
   - Make the necessary changes to the code or documentation using your preferred text editor or integrated development environment (IDE).

5. Commit Changes:
   - Use `git status` to check the modified files.
   - Use `git add <file(s)>` to add the changes to the staging area.
   - Commit the changes with a descriptive commit message using `git commit -m "Your commit message"`.

6. Push Changes to Your Fork:
   - Push the changes to your forked repository on GitHub using `git push origin your-branch-name`.

7. Create a Pull Request:
   - Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
   - Click on the "Compare & pull request" button to start creating a pull request.
   - Provide a descriptive title and details about your changes in the pull request description.
   - Review the changes and click "Create Pull Request" to send the request to the original repository.

10. Merge Your Contribution:
   - Once your pull request is approved, the maintainers will merge your changes into the main branch of the original repository.
